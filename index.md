# Welcome to quickemcee's site

## About

A Python library to quickly set up MCMC scripts based on the `emcee` package. Includes functions and classes to quickly set up `emcee` objects, run MCMC, and analyze the results with minimum effort from the end user. 

## Installation

```
pip install quickemcee
```

### Test installation

`quickemcee` should work out of the box, but there is a script in the Github repo called 'testquickemcee.py' to run in case you want to test the installation. If everything is OK the console should print two progress bars, and then display four images, after the computations are over.
